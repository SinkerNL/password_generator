# password_generator
Python program that generates passwords. A password generator at least needs to have the following requirements:

- Create password that are not guessable by a 'human'.
- You should be able to pick the length of the password.
- You should be able to choose whether it should consist:
    - Capital letter
    - Numbers
    - Special characters
- Password should automatically be send to clipboard (configurable).

Other important parts of the password generator are:
- It should be programmed in such a way, that it can be easily incorporated in other programs (use of OOP).
- Also possible to run from command line.
- Some sort of security should be incorporated.
